# 👋 Hi, I'm Sahar Zargarzadeh

🎓 Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science – AI/ML | 🤖 ML Intern @ HP  
📍 Based in Austin, Texas | 🌐 [saharzargarzadeh.github.io](https://saharzargarzadeh.github.io/)  

---

I'm a Ph.D. researcher specializing in **adversarial machine learning**, **power-based side-channel analysis**, and **IoT security**. My current research focuses on evading AI-powered malware detection by perturbing power signatures using deep learning and explainability tools such as SHAP. I enjoy applying cutting-edge ML techniques to real-world problems, especially at the intersection of **security**, **embedded systems**, and **AI robustness**.

💼 I'm currently interning with the **Personal Devices team at HP**, working on deploying secure and interpretable AI/ML pipelines using **Vertex AI** and **TensorFlow**.
