# 👋 Hi, I'm Sahar Zargarzadeh

🎓 Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science – AI/ML | 🤖 ML Intern @ HP  
📍 Based in Austin, Texas | 🌐 [saharzargarzadeh.github.io](https://saharzargarzadeh.github.io/)  

---

I'm a Ph.D. researcher specializing in **adversarial machine learning**, **power-based side-channel analysis**, and **IoT security**. My work focuses on building **robust anomaly detection systems** using **multimodal data** (e.g., power traces, system calls), and enhancing them with **transformer-based architectures** and **explainable AI**.

💼 I'm currently interning with the **Personal Devices team at HP**, incorporate **Microsoft Threat Modeling** practices into secure and interpretable AI/ML pipelines using **Vertex AI** and **TensorFlow**.

If you're interested in my research work on AI robustness and adversarial attacks on IoT devices, check out my latest post:
